= addx V takes two cycles to complete. Â¨
After two cycles, the X register is increased by the value V.
= noop takes one cycle to complete. It has no other effect.

During the first cycle, X is 1.
The signal strength (the cycle number multiplied by the value of the X register).

Find the signal strength during the 20th, 60th, 100th, 140th, 180th, and 220th cycles. 
What is the sum of these six signal strengths?

"""
The X register controls the horizontal position of a sprite. 
The sprite is 3 pixels wide, and the X register sets the horizontal position of the middle of that sprite.
The pixels on the CRT: 40 wide and 6 high.
The left-most pixel in each row is in position 0, and the right-most pixel in each row is in position 39.
The CRT draws a single pixel during each cycle.
If the sprite is positioned such that one of its three pixels is the pixel currently being drawn, the screen produces a lit pixel (#); otherwise, the screen leaves the pixel dark (.).

Render the image given by your program. What eight capital letters appear on your CRT?
